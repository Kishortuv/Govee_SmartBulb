## ðŸ”§ Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- A compatible BLE adapter (e.g., built-in BLE on Raspberry Pi)
- Govee BLE-capable smart bulb (tested on model H6001 / H6085 / etc.)
- To work with Smart Bulb create our own python virtual environment

  ```bash
  python3 -m venv smart_bulb
  source smart_bulb/bin/activate

### ðŸ›  Python Packages/Libraries

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install dbus-python - For IPC Communication
